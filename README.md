BulkCityLandingPagesWP
======================
Currently this works in WordPress 3.5.2.

Create multiple geographically targeted landing pages quickly using generic text &amp; automatically inserted city names.  This is a mod to work with the All In One SEO plugin.

While it's currently targeted to be used for cities it can actually be used for any keywords you want to mass generate pages for.

It's based off the wordpress plugin Bulk City Landing Pages:
